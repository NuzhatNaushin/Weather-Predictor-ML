# Weather Predictor Using ML

##Overview
A machine learning-based weather prediction model that forecasts average temperature (TAVG), precipitation (PRCP), and other weather metrics for a given station and date in Bangladesh. 

## Dataset
- Data sourced from [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/).
- Features include temperature, precipitation, etc.

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Usage 
- Open the .ipynb file in Google Colab.
- Run the cells to train and evaluate the models.

## Future Improvements
- Adding more features.
- Deploying as a web app.
